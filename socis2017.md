# Summer of Code in Space 2017

We are proposing a project for the [Summer of Code in Space 2017 programme](https://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis/)!

The spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics are a fundamental tool used in studying gravitational waves --- ripples in space and
time generated by extremely dense, compact objects such as spinning black holes. This has recently become a hot area of
physics research, following last year's historic
[detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO collaboration](http://www.ligo.org/news/detection-press-release.pdf). The 
gravitational waves detected by LIGO were generated over a billion years ago by the merger of a pair of spinning black holes 
in a distant galaxy.

The LIGO discovery was not the only historic breakthrough for gravitational wave detection in 2016. We also witnessed the
launch of the overwhelmingly successful [ESA](http://www.esa.int)-led mission,
[LISA Pathfinder](http://sci.esa.int/lisa-pathfinder/); a mission
dedicated to demonstrating state of the art technologies required for space-based gravitational wave detectors.
These results together have paved the way for [LISA](https://www.elisascience.org) (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), the 
planned space-based gravitational wave detector. Following the selection of
[The Gravitational Universe](http://sci.esa.int/cosmic-vision/58543-the-gravitational-universe/) as the science theme for the
third L-class mission in the ESA's Cosmic Vision programme, the LISA mission has stood out as the best way of
addressing this science goal. LISA is currently in an ESA Phase 0 study with overwhelmingly positive feedback to date, so the
time is ripe for the development of the tools that we will need to interpret the signals from such a mission.

As was demonstrated by LIGO, a crucial component in the detection and analysis of gravitational wave signals is a detailed 
model for the expected signal --- or *waveform* --- from the merger of a pair of black holes. In the case of LISA, this
translates to developing a bank of waveform templates for a particular class of binary black hole system called an Extreme 
Mass Ratio Inspiral. Black hole perturbation theory is **the** method of choice for producing these templates and
spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics are at the heart of what makes black hole perturbation theory such an efficient tool.
As an added bonus, the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics also have applications in other areas of physics such as
electromagnetism and fluid mechanics.

Up to now, the SpinWeightedSpheroidalHarmonics project has provided a robust set of tools for computing spin-weighted
spheroidal harmonics using [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/). This imposes several
restrictions, most notably that it requires the commercial (and expensive) Wolfram Mathematica software. It also
makes it difficult to run calculations on a supercomputer, where many calculations can be effeciently run in parallel.

For this reason it is highly desirable to have a fully open implementation, written in a fully open-source language
such as C/C++ or Python. Unfortunately, no such implementation exists...yet!

## Project outline

The goal of the project is to develop a C/C++ and/or Python code for computing spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics.

### Phase 1: Identify Existing Tools to be Used in the Project
The project will rely on several key components as building blocks:
1. Code for evaluating continued fractions.
2. Code for solving three-term recurrence relations.
3. Code for root finding.
4. Code for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices.
5. Code for computing spin-weighted spherical harmonics.

Many of these are already available as part of open-source software libraries such as the
[GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), [Boost](http://www.boost.org) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org).

The first phase of the project will require the student to survey existing available tools and identify the appropriate
building blocks on which to base the project.

### Phase 2: Develop Code for Computing the Spheroidal Eigenvalue (spin-0)

Once suitable tools have been identified for the numerical methods which will be used in the main code, the first
programming stage will involve the development of code for computing the so-called spheroidal eigenvalue. This would
be implemented by adapting the existing Mathematica code, and converting it to either C/C++ or Python.

### Phase 3: Develop Code for Computing the Spheroidal Harmonic (spin-0)

With robust code for computing the spheroidal eigenvalue finished, the student will then move on to developing
code for computing the eigenfunctions, i.e. the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics themselves. As before, this would
be implemented by adapting the existing Mathematica code, and converting it to either C/C++ or Python.

### Phase 4: Extend Code to Support Computing the Spin-Weighted Spheroidal Eigenvalue and Spin-Weighted Spheroidal Harmonics

The final phase of the project will extend the existing code to support the *spin-weighted* spheroidal harmonics on which
gravitational-wave models are based. This will involve a generalisation of the existing code, but again the Mathematica
implementation can be used as a reference.

## Eligibility criteria

This project requires experience with C/C++ and/or Python. It is also highly desirable to have experience with Mathematica (in
order to understand the existing code) and ideally some experience of studying General Relativity at university level.
